## About the connector
RidgeBot validates security vulnerabilities in your organization by using real POC codes to exploit the vulnerability. This connector facilitates automated operation such as creating and executing penetration testing tasks.
<p>This document provides information about the Ridge Security RidgeBot Connector, which facilitates automated interactions, with a Ridge Security RidgeBot server using FortiSOAR&trade; playbooks. Add the Ridge Security RidgeBot Connector as a step in FortiSOAR&trade; playbooks and perform automated operations with Ridge Security RidgeBot.</p>

## Included playbooks
The `Sample - ridgebot - 1.0.0` playbook collection comes bundled with the Ridge Security RidgeBot connector. These playbooks contain steps using which you can perform all supported actions. You can see bundled playbooks in the **Automation** > **Playbooks** section in FortiSOAR<sup>TM</sup> after importing the Ridge Security RidgeBot connector.

- Create Task
- Generate And Download
- Get Task Info
- Get Task Statistics
- Stop Task

**Note**: If you are planning to use any of the sample playbooks in your environment, ensure that you clone those playbooks and move them to a different collection, since the sample playbook collection gets deleted during connector upgrade and delete.
